## Intro - 3 min

Thank you for joining us today! Today we're going to chat about your experiences helping Veterans who have incurred VA healthcare charges. We're currently working on incorporating VHA debt into VA.gov's debt management portal, and we want to ensure that our designs will solve real Veterans' problems. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes for me.

* Since we only have an hour to chat, I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic to keep us on track.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  

## Interview Questions - 30 min

**About their work/departments**

First, I'd like to ask you a little bit about your job and department.

* How would you describe your role?
* Can you tell me about what services your department provides?
* What sort of experience or knowledge do you have that you feel will be valuable for us to draw from when designing for online VHA debt tools?
* Can you tell me a little more about the departments of VHA that touch the debt process, if they exist?  

**About operations** 

Now, I'd like to dig more into your interactions with Veterans.

* How many Veterans do you typically assist a day?
* What types of calls do you receive most often?
* Do you only receive calls about VHA copayments?
* What does a typical call look like?
* How long do these calls tend to last?
* Are there other methods Veterans use to reach out for assistance?  (ie IRIS, email, etc.)
* Is there anything that you're not really able to discuss with Veterans?
* What sort of goals are placed on you and those on your team? 
* What constraints do you have to work with?
* How do you think an online tool becoming available for Veterans could help you as a representative?
* Can you describe the types of debt that a Veteran might receive from VHA? 
  * How big are the debts, usually? 
  * How big can they get?  

**About the Veterans **

Next, I want to know a little more about the Veterans themselves

* What kind of problems do you think Veterans are experiencing with their copayments?
* Do Veterans typically know which priority group they're assigned to? 
* What type of financial assistance do Veterans request most often? 
* What sort of questions do Veterans typically have?  

**Repayment plans**
We also have a few questions about the repayment plans themselves.
* We noticed that payment plans usually require the Veteran to pay off the debt within 3 years - are longer repayment plans ever granted?
* What is the process if the Veteran cannot pay off the debt after 3 years?
* Is there a minimum monthly amount VHA will accept?
* We noticed that Veterans need to submit VA Form 1100 to set up a payment plan; do Veterans ever submit an FSR for payment plans?
  * If so, what would the next steps be?  

**Additional questions**
We just have a couple of stray questions for you before we wrap up.
* What impact do you think providing Veterans access to their copayments online will have?
* Do you have any copayment stats you'd like to share with us?
* Is there any other information you think we should know about how Veterans interact with their copayments?  

## Task: VHA flow workshop - 25 min

I'm going to share my screen and pull up a diagram that shows our understanding of the VHA debt process as it stands today.

_Moderator shares their screen and navigates to [the Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kxbu2M4=/?moveToWidget=3074457354814915958&cot=14)._

Okay! So now we're going to look at this flow together to make sure I understand things correctly. We had to draw some assumptions while making this, so if something's wrong, feel free to shout it out! I've also got a bunch of questions to ask, so we will try to get to as many of those as possible before the end of our session.

_Moderator works through flow with representatives._

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 min

That's all the questions I have for you! 

* Do you have any questions for me?
* Can you think of anyone else we should talk to that might be able to provide more insight into the VA copayment process? 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
