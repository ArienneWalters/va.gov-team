## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Leyda. I also have some colleagues on the line listening and taking notes.
Today we'll be discussing ideas for a new webpage that will live on the VA's website. We're looking for Veteran's input on how to make it better.

Before we get started, I want to give you an idea of what this call will be like:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes.
- We'll start with my asking you a couple warm up questions
- Then we'll do a bit of technical set up of Zoom. So that I can follow along with you today, I'll be having you share your Zoom screen and I'll help you through that.
- We'll look at a prototype of a website togther and we'll be discussing that for the remainder of the session. 
- Throughout the session, I'll be asking you about your thoughts and opinions about the information and content on the pages but there are no right or wrong answers. We're not testing you. We're actually testing the designs and the information contained on the pages to see how we can make them better for Veterans. So, I welcome your honest and candid feedback but if at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can simply move on to the next question. 
- This session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after the call is analyzed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 

 - If yes: 
 
**Once I start recording, I will ask again to confirm that you're ok with me recording this session so that it's captured in the recording.** 

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- **I have started recording.** So, I'd like to confirm:

Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

Ok, great. Thank you for that.


## Warm-up Questions 

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

Thanks for sharing that. 



## Counseling services 

For the purpose of this session, we'll be mostly focused on mental health care services offered at the VA. 
  
  - Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:
  - can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?
  - have you participated in any of these services?
  - how was that experience?
  
  
## Zoom sharing set-up

We're going to switch gears now and look at website together.  It's going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. Because it is a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would.

## Scenario
 
Before we look at the website, I'm going to give you a scenario to consider. Imagine you have a Veteran friend who's been going through a rough time. You think this person could benefit from some mental health care or counseling. You do a little digging for them on the internet. 

 - Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this?
 - What words would you use to get you this type of information?

## Prototype

Now let's imagine that as you're searching, you land on a website. 

I'm going to send you a link to that website. 

[Share link to prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/603da0b67ccefbbee74fcd8bb77a8fed12baabb5#/pages/134612636/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhidmhttp://)

I'm going to give you a minute or two to look the page over. As I mentioned, this is just a prototype so it won't be fully functional but feel free to click around. As you're looking, I'd like for you to think out loud your observations and any the thoughts that come to mind.

 - What can you tell me about this place?
 
 - How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?
 
 - Is there any type of care that you don't think you can get here?
 
 - What type of services do you think could benefit your friend?
 
 - What are the most important services offered here?
 
 - What services are less important?
```What are you trying to learn from the importance questions? Relevance to the individual? One might argue all services offered are important, but maybe not as relevant for every Veteran. I could see this line of questioning going sideways.``` 
 
Let's imagine that your friend is the type of person that prefers one-on-one interactions with people. 

 - Could your friend get one-on-one counseling here?

 - What would you be able to tell your friend about individual counseling at this location?
 
Let's imagine that your friend is a real people person and misses the camaraderie from the service.  

 - What kind of services would likely be appealing in this case? 

 - Is there any additional information that you think should be added about the services listed here?

 - What can you tell me about Vet Centers locations? 
 
 - Where would your friend be able to go for services?
 
 - What type of services would be available at another location?

#### Locations page 

 - In your own words, describe the relationship between the different locations listed on this page?
 ```Phrasing like 'what do you think..." feels like you're testing them. Asking them to put things in their own words allows you to both test comprehension and also see how they would describe back to you what you've shown them.``` 
 

#### General website questions

We're almost done. I just have a few more questions left. Now that you've had a chance to learn all about the Atlanta Vet Center,
 
 - If this were for you, what would you do next? ```Phrasing is awkward. Not clear what you mean.``` 
 
 - What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?
 ```By asking them "is there anything missing" you're biasing toward the pleasers who will say "no". Give them the opportunity to identify what they think is missing. If there's nothing, they will say "nothing."``` 
 
 - Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?
 ```Same comment as above``` 
 
 - What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

 
## Post-Task Interview

Those are all the questions that I had for you today. 

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?


## Thank-You and Closing 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
