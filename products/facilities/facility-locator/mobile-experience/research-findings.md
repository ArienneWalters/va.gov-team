View the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/mobile-experience/research-plan.md).
## Research Goals 
- Understand how Veterans expectations for Find a VA Location search results differ for mobile vs desktop users
- Understand how industry standards impact Veteran expectations for the Facility Locator search experience
- Evaluate new designs created for geolocation, map view, and clear fields
- Validate if veterans are interested in using the map view of the Facility Locator (validate findings in the mobile month study)

## Research Methodology 
We conducted a remote, moderated, task-oriented usability study, using Zoom
- Participants logged into Zoom with their mobile device, shared their screen and opened up the prototype for us to observe their interaction.
- The participants had to imagine a couple of scenarios and were given tasks to perform within the prototype on their mobile phones.

The structure of the study:
- 2 minutes for introduction and helping participant to share their mobile screen on Zoom
- 2 minutes for warm-up questions 
- Approximately 20-30 minutes with usability tasks and questions
- 2-4 min for exit questions and wrap-up

### Who we talked to

The participants in this study consistend of 10 veterans:
- 5 male and 5 female
- 4 from rural area, 6 from a major metropolitan area
- Between 35 and 83 years old (8 of 10 was 55 years or older)
- A mix of educational level 
- 5 used Android and 5 used an Apple iPhone

### Research Questions

*Search box*
- Do participants understand how to enable their location?
- Do participants understand how to clear inputs?

*Search results*
- What are Veteran expectations of Facility Locator mobile experience?
- Will Veterans notice/understand the Geolocation functionality?
- Do Veterans using a mobile device prefer to view results on the map or in a list?
- Do Veterans expect to find detailed information on the map view?
- Do veterans know how to bring up the detailed information for each location?
- Does the information presented for a given facility match expectations?
- Does the Veteran understand how to find more detailed information about the facilities returned?
- What online maps/searches do these participants find easiest to use/why?

## Key Findings

1. Participants **had a variety of past experiences with the VA facility locator**, from “...it was a nightmare” to “...it was pretty easy”.
2. Most participants **did not utilize the “Use My Location” link.** A few did not notice it but said they might use it if they noticed it, a few do not want to use location services at all, and a few participants noticed it and thought it could be useful, but found it irrelevant to the task/scenario given to them.
3. Most participants **did not use the “x” icon to clear their address** and retype a new address.
4. **Choosing Facility type and Service Type was easy for most participants** when given the task to look for optometry. 
5. **Most participants found both the list and map view to be useful** depending on their circumstance.    
6. **About half the participants did not notice the map view on their own** without prompting.  
7. **Most participants understood that they could tap on a pin to view details in the map**, however after that, **they didn’t seem to understand overall how to dismiss and view other locations.** Overall there was awkwardness in the way participants interacted with the new map view designs and switched between map and list views. 


## Details of Findings
### 1. Participants had a variety of past experiences with the VA facility locator, from “...it was a nightmare” to “...it was pretty easy”
### 2. Most participants did not utilize the “Use My Location” link.
There were a variety of reasons folks were not using the "Use my location" link.  
- 3 of 10 were hesitant to using the location feature on their phones in general 
- 3 of 10 participants said they saw the Use my location feature and might use it, but they did not think to use it, because of the wording of the task.
- A few others did not see the feature at all
### 3. Most participants **did not use the “x” icon to clear their address** and retype a new address.
### 4. **Choosing Facility type and Service Type was easy for most participants** when given the task to look for optometry. 
### 5. **Most participants found both the list and map view to be useful** depending on their circumstance.    
### 6. **About half the participants did not notice the map view on their own** without prompting.  
### 7. **Most participants understood that they could tap on a pin to view details in the map**, however after that, **they didn’t seem to understand overall how to dismiss and view other locations.** Overall there was awkwardness in the way participants interacted with the new map view designs and switched between map and list views. 

## Additional Insights
* Regarding details on the list view and cards
   * Three participants wanted to see hours of operation on the card (and "is this open now?")
   * One participant mentioned wanting to click on the notification (e.g. "limited service and hours") to learn more about what that meant.
   * One participant wanted to see services on the card 
   * One pariticpant was confused at why the card wasn't customized for his service type, e.g. why was he seeing the mental health line when he searched for optometry
* Some participants were interested in more options as filters before they click "search"
   * one wanted to pick radius (in miles) 
   * one wanted to pick service **first** e.g. pick Optometry first instead of VA Health
   * One wanted a filter where he could see if there was VA transportation available to bring him to the facility
* Folks didn't care that much about "how many results" they saw, they cared more about seeing relevent results

## Recommendations
- If the team is implementing the "Use my location" and "Clear address" features, pay attention to analytics and whether or not they are being used. Consider further testing in staging or production to determine whether the features are prominent enough for those that want to use them
- Do not implement the new "pin and swipable card" design that was tested
- Instead, consider an iteration to the design that does away with the tabs and has the map and list views more integrated with each other, where a veteran could more seamlessly switch between the two views. See Airbnb's responsive mobile experience or Google maps responsive mobile experience for examples.
