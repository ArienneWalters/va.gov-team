Hello, 

The VA.gov team at the Department of Veterans Affairs is building a new web experience designed to help Veterans find answers to questions about their VA benefits and services. We are looking for Veterans who are interested in participating in a card sort to help us improve this new experience. 

**What will I be doing?**
You will be sent links to 2 card sorts.  asking you to sort article titles into categories. If the pre-defined categories don't feel right, you will have the opportunity to create your own categories. There are no wrong answers. 

**How long is a session?**
The session is self-guided. We estimate it will take you 10-20 minutes to complete both card sorts. You can do this at any time that is convient for you. We ask that you try to complete the card sorts by [date]. 

**Interested in participating?**
Please reply to this email if you are interested in participating. We will give you a unique code to track if you have completed both card sorts. There will be a space for you to enter this code at the end of each card sort.
