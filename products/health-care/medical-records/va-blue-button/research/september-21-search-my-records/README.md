This was a study that the Bylight team for MHV completed in September 2021. 
# Search My VA Health Record Overview

**Initial Product Overview**

VA product (Search My VA Health Record) of My HealtheVet, on the PHR development team. The desire is to improve the efficiency (the amount of effort and resources put into the task), productivity (achieving the best output), and end-user satisfaction (fulfilling the needs and desires) when Veterans are accessing and downloading a copy of their VA health records for personal usage. 

**Search My Record was created from the idea of Blue Button:** the design provides Veterans with new functionalities (to serve both novice and advanced computer users) and capabilities (the ability to form a needed task with useful features). A Veteran can select a date range, category (health records), facility (locations), and instantly see the generated results on the screen (without having to download the records).

## Problem Statement
Explore ways of improving the Veteran experience when searching and downloading health records. How might we enable Veterans with more flexibility, control, and speed when searching or/and downloading health records?
