# Research Plan for C/IA: Confluence Pilot Round 1, 2020 Q4

## Goals	
1. What product [tool/service/document/process] & VSP team are you doing this research for?

This research is for the Confluence pilot developer documentation on the C/IA team.  The C/IA team wants to interview VFS devs, to conduct a coherence check on our experimental IA.
	
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? Link to the product outline.

VSP acquired Confluence Â¾-ways through September, as a new solution to house our VFS-facing docs (aka allow VFS team to build more autonomously on VA.GOV).  This research plan is related to [Confluence Documentation: Product Outline (GitHub)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/documentation-site/product-outline.md).

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 

How do VFS devs refer to and categorize tasks including but not limited to [the tasks in this xls](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10aEG_NoXln3KYPWmfpHVfdWxdpMIAGnxo4DyJWsMefE/edit#gid=1800805880).

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

We hypothesize that the new developer docs IA will be easier to navigate than our GitHub documentation.

## Method	
1. What method of research are you planning?

We will be using a combo of directed interviews and tree sorts.

2.	Where are you planning to do your research?

Since all these methods will be synchronous, we will be using Zoom.

3.	What will you be testing?

## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	

We want our participant population to: Have an equal gender representation, have an equal VSA and non-VSA representation, and be BE developers.  Participant population listed in the [first tab of this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m7rd7pi2QbiQUhMwgIlgYIJ1t0UqFGV_h6_43O9vauo/edit#gid=582348372).

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	

Beginning of November to mid-December

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 

n/a

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?

30-45 minutes

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Keep in mind that VFS team members are also remote and live in different time zones. Try and keep research sessions during normal working hours.	

n/a

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	

n/a
