# Contact Center Training Video Process

**Overview:**: How to create Product Videos for the Contact Center Review in the Build Stage of the Collaboration Cycle.

**Audience**: VFS teams building on VA.gov

## Process

Training videos are the video version of the product guide and are created by VFS teams for contact centers to help Veterans troubleshoot VA.gov.  

When your team is at the [Prepare for Contact Center Review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/contact-center/request-contact-center-review.md#prepare-for-contact-center-review) stage, reach out to the Contact Center POCs on #vsp-contact-center-support Slack channel to set up a video meeting. The contact center training videos will be created by recording the Zoom call so that we can capture the closed captioning.  

During the video, your team will walk though the primary flows of the product, using layman terms whenever possible. 
One or both of the Contact Center POCs should also be on the call to see the product in use and to ask any potential follow up questions.

If neither Contact Center POCs are available, the video can still be created by the team and sent to the #vsp-contact-center-support Slack channel for review.
